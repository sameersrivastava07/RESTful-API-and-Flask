State Transfer API, and it is used for communication between different software applications over the internet.\n","\n","---> It works using common HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on data.\n","\n","--->>> One key feature of RESTful APIs is that they are stateless, which means each request from a client must contain all the information needed, as the server doesn’t store any previous request data.\n","\n","--> REST APIs usually exchange data in formats like JSON or XML.\n","\n","--->> For example, if Sameer is using a pwskills course app, and it needs to show his progress, the app might send a GET request to:\n","https://api.pwskills.com/students/sameer123\n","\n","This makes RESTful APIs very useful for building simple, fast, and scalable web services.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-KXfKI4rGNZS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:2--->> Explain the concept of API specification?\n","\n","Answer:2-->>>\n","\n","\\---> API specification is like a detailed guide or blueprint that explains how an API should work.\n","\n","\\---> It defines the rules, formats, and conventions that developers need to follow to use or build that API properly.\n","\n","\\--->>> It usually includes information about the available endpoints (URLs), the methods (GET, POST, etc.) allowed, the data formats accepted and returned, and any authentication needed.\n","\n","\\--> This helps both the API creators and users to understand exactly how to communicate without confusion.\n","\n","\\--->> For example, pwskills might provide an API specification document explaining how Sameer or other students can access course details, submit assignments, or check progress using the API.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZHoXJjdMGrmM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:3--->> What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n","\n","Answer:3-->>>\n","\n","\\---> Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that helps us build web applications and APIs quickly and easily.\n","\n","\\---> It provides the basic tools needed to handle web requests and responses but keeps things simple without extra complexity.\n","\n","\\--->>> Flask is popular for building APIs because it is very flexible, easy to learn, and allows developers to add only the features they need without unnecessary overhead.\n","\n","\\--> Many developers, including those like Sameer working on pwskills projects, prefer Flask because it makes creating RESTful APIs fast and efficient.\n","\n","\\--->> Also, Flask has a large community and many extensions, which makes adding features like database support or security easier.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uOJ_J8p1GtO8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:4--->> What is routing in Flask?\n","\n","Answer:4-->>>\n","\n","\\---> Routing in Flask means deciding which function should run when a user visits a particular URL in a web application.\n","\n","\\---> It connects URLs to the code that handles requests, so when we open a webpage or call an API, Flask knows what to do.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, if Sameer creates a pwskills API and sets a route `/courses`, whenever someone visits that URL, Flask will run the function that sends the list of courses.\n","\n","\\--> Routing helps organize the app so different URLs do different things easily.\n","\n","\\--->> In short, routing is like the map that guides web requests to the right part of the program.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wFLCaaz9G16F"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:5--->> How do you create a simple Flask application?\n","\n","Answer:5-->>>\n","\n","\\---> To create a simple Flask application, we start by installing Flask and then writing a small Python script to set up the app.\n","\n","\\---> The script usually imports Flask, creates an app object, and defines routes that tell the app what to do when someone visits a URL.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, if we want to show \"Hello, pwskills!\" on the home page, we create a route for `/` and return that message in the function.\n","\n","\\--> This simple structure makes it easy to build and test web apps quickly.\n","\n","\\--->> For instance, Sameer might create a simple Flask app to show a welcome message before adding more features later.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LFzFmOMoG-R2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:6--->> What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n","\n","Answer:6-->>>\n","\n","\\---> HTTP methods are special commands that tell a RESTful API what kind of action we want to perform on the data.\n","\n","\\---> The most common HTTP methods are **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE**.\n","\n","\\--->>> GET is used to request data from a server, like asking pwskills API to send a list of courses.\n","\n","\\--> POST is used to send new data to the server, like adding a new student record.\n","\n","\\--->> PUT updates existing data, for example, changing Sameer’s progress in a course.\n","\n","\\---> DELETE removes data, like deleting an old assignment from the database.\n","\n","These methods help organize API actions clearly and follow web standards.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UatinfoqHFgb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:7--->> What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n","\n","Answer:7-->>>\n","\n","\\---> The `@app.route()` decorator in Flask is used to specify the URL (or route) that will trigger a particular function in the app.\n","\n","\\---> It connects a web address to the code that should run when someone visits that address.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, if we write `@app.route('/home')`, then whenever someone opens the `/home` page, Flask will run the function right below that decorator.\n","\n","\\--> This makes it easy to organize what happens for different URLs in the app.\n","\n","\\--->> Sameer might use `@app.route()` to create different pages or API endpoints in his pwskills project.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"48sME-eoHOGl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:8--->> What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n","\n","Answer:8-->>>\n","\n","\\---> GET method is used to request or retrieve data from a server. It sends data through the URL and is mostly used to get information without changing anything on the server.\n","\n","\\---> POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update something. It sends data in the request body, not visible in the URL, and can change the server’s state.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, when we visit a pwskills course page, a GET request fetches the course details.\n","\n","\\--> But when Sameer submits a new assignment, a POST request sends that data to the server.\n","\n","\\--->> So, GET is mostly for reading data, while POST is for sending or saving data.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5psm60UKHdcb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:9--->> How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n","\n","Answer:9-->>>\n","\n","\\---> In Flask APIs, we handle errors by writing special functions called error handlers that catch problems like wrong URLs or server issues.\n","\n","\\---> These handlers can send back helpful messages or codes to tell users what went wrong.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, if someone asks for a pwskills course that doesn’t exist, Flask can return a “404 Not Found” error with a friendly message.\n","\n","\\--> We can also use `try-except` blocks inside our API functions to catch and manage specific errors, like database connection problems.\n","\n","\\--->> This way, we make sure the API doesn’t crash and users get clear information when errors happen.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gRQrZIYwHerz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:10--->> How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n","\n","Answer:10-->>>\n","\n","\\---> To connect Flask to a SQL database, we usually use an extension like Flask-SQLAlchemy, which makes it easier to work with databases inside Flask.\n","\n","\\---> First, we install the extension and then configure the database URL in the Flask app settings to tell Flask where the database is.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, Sameer might connect pwskills Flask app to a MySQL or SQLite database by providing the connection details.\n","\n","\\--> After setting it up, we can create database models in Python to represent tables and perform operations like add, read, update, or delete data easily.\n","\n","\\--->> This integration helps build apps that can store and manage data efficiently.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UzeHEKR1HqRX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:11--->> What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n","\n","Answer:11-->>>\n","\n","\\---> Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that helps us work with SQL databases easily using Python code.\n","\n","\\---> It acts as a bridge between Flask and the database, so we don’t have to write complicated SQL queries directly.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, instead of writing SQL commands, we can create classes in Python that represent database tables, and Flask-SQLAlchemy takes care of converting those into SQL.\n","\n","\\--> This makes it easier for developers like Sameer or us to add, update, or delete data from the database inside a Flask app.\n","\n","\\--->> Overall, it simplifies database management and makes coding faster and cleaner.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qwusRbaxH1kt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:12--->> What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n","\n","Answer:12-->>>\n","\n","\\---> Flask blueprints are a way to organize a Flask application into smaller, reusable parts or modules.\n","\n","\\---> They let us split big apps into different sections, each with its own routes and functions, making the code easier to manage.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, in a pwskills project, Sameer might use one blueprint for user management and another for courses.\n","\n","\\--> Blueprints help us keep the code clean and allow multiple developers to work on different parts without conflicts.\n","\n","\\--->> They also make it simple to reuse or share parts of the app in other projects.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HlZ73SI1H_FZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:13--->> What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n","\n","Answer:13-->>>\n","\n","\\---> The `request` object in Flask holds all the information about the client’s request to the server.\n","\n","\\---> It lets us access data sent by the user, like form inputs, JSON data, query parameters, and headers.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, if Sameer’s pwskills app receives data when a user submits a form, the `request` object helps get that data inside the Flask function.\n","\n","\\--> This way, we can read what the user wants or sent and respond accordingly.\n","\n","\\--->> So, the `request` object is key to handling input and interacting with users in Flask apps.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hPWHEyamIHze"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:14--->> How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n","\n","Answer:14-->>>\n","\n","\\---> To create a RESTful API endpoint in Flask, we define a route using the `@app.route()` decorator, specifying the URL and HTTP method like GET or POST.\n","\n","\\---> Inside the function for that route, we write the code to handle requests and send responses, usually in JSON format.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, in a pwskills app, we might create an endpoint `/courses` that returns a list of courses when someone sends a GET request.\n","\n","\\--> This way, clients can interact with our app by calling different API endpoints to get or send data.\n","\n","\\--->> Flask makes it simple to build RESTful APIs by combining routes, HTTP methods, and JSON responses.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IDQSYfJFISMM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:15--->> What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n","\n","Answer:15-->>>\n","\n","\\---> The `jsonify()` function in Flask helps convert Python data like dictionaries or lists into JSON format, which is easy to send over the web.\n","\n","\\---> It also sets the right content-type in the response so the client knows it’s receiving JSON data.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, if Sameer’s pwskills app wants to send course details as a response, `jsonify()` makes sure the data is formatted properly.\n","\n","\\--> This makes communication between the Flask API and clients smoother and standardized.\n","\n","\\--->> So, `jsonify()` is important for returning data in a way that web clients can understand easily.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"4HJZxLN_IdT1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:16--->> Explain Flask’s url\\_for() function\n","\n","Answer:16-->>>\n","\n","\\---> The `url_for()` function in Flask helps us build URLs for different routes in a flexible way.\n","\n","\\---> Instead of hardcoding URLs, we use `url_for()` with the function name, so if the route changes, the code still works fine.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, in pwskills app, Sameer might use `url_for('home')` to get the URL of the home page without typing the full path.\n","\n","\\--> It also helps add parameters to URLs easily when needed.\n","\n","\\--->> Overall, `url_for()` makes navigation and linking in Flask apps more reliable and easier to maintain.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SRjJxgFbItw-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:17--->> How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n","\n","Answer:17-->>>\n","\n","\\---> Flask automatically serves static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images from a special folder named `static`.\n","\n","\\---> When we put files inside the `static` folder, Flask makes them accessible through URLs starting with `/static/`.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, Sameer’s pwskills app can use a CSS file by placing it in `static/css/style.css` and linking it in HTML as `/static/css/style.css`.\n","\n","\\--> This way, Flask helps us organize and serve all the front-end assets easily without extra setup.\n","\n","\\--->> So, Flask’s built-in static file handling makes it simple to add styles and scripts to web apps.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QF6oBRWJIvTA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:18--->> What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n","\n","Answer:18-->>>\n","\n","\\---> An API specification is a detailed document that describes how an API should work, including its endpoints, request types, input/output formats, and error handling.\n","\n","\\---> It acts like a blueprint that tells developers exactly what to expect and how to interact with the API.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, when Sameer is building a pwskills Flask API, having an API specification helps him and others understand how to send requests and what responses to expect.\n","\n","\\--> This makes development smoother, reduces misunderstandings, and helps in testing and documentation.\n","\n","\\--->> So, API specifications are important for clear communication and efficient building of Flask APIs.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oaDO86_9I4-Z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:19--->> What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n","\n","Answer:19-->>>\n","\n","\\---> HTTP status codes are numbers sent by the server to tell the client how their request went, like whether it was successful or if there was an error.\n","\n","\\---> They help both the client and server understand what happened without needing to read the full message.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, in Sameer’s pwskills Flask API, a status code 200 means the request was successful, while 404 means the requested resource wasn’t found.\n","\n","\\--> Using proper status codes helps clients handle responses correctly and improves the API’s clarity and reliability.\n","\n","\\--->> So, HTTP status codes are very important for communication between Flask APIs and their users.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hVxrkieJJBof"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question:20--->> How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n","\n","Answer:20-->>>\n","\n","\\---> In Flask, we handle POST requests by defining routes that accept the POST method using the `methods` parameter in the `@app.route()` decorator.\n","\n","\\---> Inside the route function, we use Flask’s `request` object to access the data sent by the client, like form data or JSON.\n","\n","\\--->>> For example, Sameer’s pwskills app might have a registration form that sends user info via POST, and Flask uses `request.form` or `request.get_json()` to get that data.\n","\n","\\--> After processing the data, the Flask app can respond accordingly, maybe saving data to a database or returning a confirmation.\n","\n","\\--->> So, handling POST requests lets Flask apps receive and process data sent by users or other
